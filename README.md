# unityBot
> The bot used by the unity Discord server.

unityBot is a robust Discord bot written in TypeScript that packs a *ton* of features. It includes a built in command parsing system, as well as a custom code block language parsing system. It can automatically generate command and code block modifier templates from the CLI to make it easy to contribute as well.

See the [documentation](https://christopherwk210.github.io/gm-bot/) to learn more.
