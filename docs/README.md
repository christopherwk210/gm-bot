# unityBot
> The bot used by the /r/unity Discord server.

unityBot is a robust Discord bot written in TypeScript that packs a *ton* of features. It includes a built in command parsing system, as well as a custom code block language parsing system. It can automatically generate command and code block modifier templates from the CLI to make it easy to contribute as well.

To get started with development, see the [Quick start](/getting-started/quick-start) for more details.
