# Quick start
In order to start development on unityBot (GMBot for short), you'll need to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/) v9.2.0 or greater installed. You can check what version you have with `node -v`.

## Installation
Clone the repo with git using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/christopherwk210/gm-bot
```

Once finished, enter the project directory and install its dependencies:
```bash
cd gm-bot && npm install --silent
```

?> `--silent` is used to suppress unnecessary peer dependency warnings.

After installation is finished, you'll need to add an `auth.json` to your project. This file provides your Discord secret token to the bot so it can properly connect. This token is provided by Discord when you [create your own bot app](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me).

The file should look like this:

```filepath
gm-bot/src/shared/assets/json/auth.json
```
```json
{
  "token": "YOUR AUTH TOKEN GOES HERE"
}
```

?> Never upload your auth file! Your token should be a secret to everyone. This file is automatically ignored by the project `.gitignore` file.

Once your auth file is in place, the bot can be started with:

```bash
npm start
```

That's it, your setup!

!> Thanks for being interested in getting involved with the development of the bot! However, before you go nuts and start contributing, please make the admins aware of the changes you are interested in making. The bot is something shared by the whole community, and so any large new additions or changes are to be considered by the admin team prior to implementation. **If you implement a big command and create a pull request without talking to the admins first, it will most likely be declined.**

To get started developing your own commands, check out [Creating commands](/getting-started/creating-commands).

## Missing peer dependencies
It is recommended that you install dependencies with the `--silent` flag so as to hide  unnecessary peer dependency warnings. These warnings are for peer dependencies of `discord.js`, the Discord API library used by GMBot. They are not required to run the bot itself, however the bot won't be able to use its audio capabilities without installing either `node-opus` or `opusscript`:
```bash
npm install node-opus
```
or:
```bash
npm install opusscript
```
Be sure to install one of these if you wish to work on anything related to the bots ability to join voice channels and play audio. Discord.js highly suggests using `node-opus` over `opusscript`.
Your system must also have FFMPEG installed for this to work.

There are other optional peer dependencies as well, which you can read about in the [discord.js docs](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome).

## A note on uncaught exceptions
By default, uncaught exceptions will **not** halt the bot process. This is done so that the bot can log exceptions directly in Discord, however the Node documentation [warns against this](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_warning_using_uncaughtexception_correctly). You can disable this feature by setting `shouldDieOnException` to `true` inside of the
`gm-bot/src/config.ts` file.

## Running the documentation locally
The documentation site can be run locally with:
```bash
npm run docs
```
